# Student Management System

-> In this project, I have tried to create a student management system.
-> So what can a student or admin of that management can do.

1. Firstly, the user have to verfiy himself through mobile otp or through email otp. (Verification)
2. Once verified he can use All student database.
3. In database he can perform operation on student like:
   1. Create Student
   2. Delete Student
   3. Update Student
   4. Display Student 
4. Above are normal methods for performing CRUD.
5. But he can also perform CRUD using REST Api also. (**IMP**)
6. For Displaying large data of student, so it is not possible in one page.
7. So for this issue implemented the PAGINATION concept (for displaying student in different page).
8. We can SEARCH a particular student in our database as well.
9. And In the main login page itself there is a small **CHATBOT**. Which is there for student help.
